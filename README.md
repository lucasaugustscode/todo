## ðŸš€ Motivation for development

This application was a challenge from the Ignite fundamentals module. As it was a simple to-list I decided to call my friend who also makes Ignite but on the ReactJS track to develop a web version and I a mobile version and integrate Firebase for the two applications to work together.
